		<h2>The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA)</h2>
		
		<p>The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA) became law on June 13, 2005. Under this landmark legislation, the Government of Ontario developed mandatory accessibility standards that organizations must follow to become more accessible. The goal for the province is to be fully accessible by 2025. All levels of government, private sector organizations, and non-profits must comply.</p>

		<h2>The Ontario Human Rights Code</h2>
		<p>The Ontario Human Rights Code ("the Code") prohibits actions that discriminate against people based on one or more protected grounds in protected social areas.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section-blue statement">
		<p>The goal of the Code is to provide equal rights and create a climate of respect where everyone feels part of the community and can contribute fully.</p>
		<p>The Code states that people with disabilities must be free from discrimination where they work, live, and receive services. Their needs must be accommodated to the point of undue hardship.</p>
